#The Happy Happy Prototype

This prototype project will show how the [ice.js](https://github.com/NYTimes/ice/) plug-in from the NY Times can be used with an editor other than the [TinyMCE](http://tinymce.com) that it was designed in mind for.  For the purposes of this experiment, we will be using the [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com) library.

##How The Prototype Will Showcase

The prototype will showcase how the ICE library can be used to track changes from the CKE editor using a single page application.  This test page will contain the editor pane on the left and a version history pane on the right.  As changes are made in the editor, the version history will have new entries added to it.
